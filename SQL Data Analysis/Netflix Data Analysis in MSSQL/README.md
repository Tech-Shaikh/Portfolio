# Netflix Shows and Movies - Data Analysis in SQL SERVER
## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to use SQL Server to clean and analyze Netflix's content data. The project's main goals are to: (1) ensure data quality through cleaning techniques; and (2) extract useful about the type of content available on Netflix, content distribution trends over time, and popular ratings among users and many more. The following important Netflix tables were analyzed using data from [Kaggle:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies?select=titles.csv)
- Data Cleaning: In the first phase, I focused on performing data cleaning tasks on a Netflix-related SQL database. The goal was to ensure data consistency and completeness in the Titles and Credits tables, which store information about movies and series, as well as the individuals credited in them. The process involved identifying missing data, handling null values, and verifying data types to ensure compatibility across different data sources.
-	Data Analysis: After cleaning, the project analyzes Netflix's content, focusing on key business questions, including the total number of movies and TV shows, the distribution of content by release year, and the most common audience ratings. These insights provide a comprehensive understanding of Netflix's content trends and user preferences.
